#React Seed

#Get Started
1. **Clone the project**. `git clone https://github.com/jvanja/react-seed`.  
2. **Install Node packages**. `npm install`
3. **Run the example app**. `npm start`  
This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser. When doing development with this kit, you'll want to keep the command line open at all times so that your code is rebuilt and tests run automatically every time you hit save.
